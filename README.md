Welcome!

Thank you for checking out my Log All The Things project

Project Description:

This is a simple logging project which reviews all of the log files on the server. Using Express, I implemented a web server that saves the data about each incoming request in a file called logs.csv. This consists of the following headers: Agent, Time, Method, Resource, Version, and Status. After a few requests have been made to localhost:3000, you can visit localhost:3000/logs and have all of the logs returned to you on the screen.

How to open:

Using the command prompt, copy and paste 'code ~/oca/startnow-node101-log-all-the-things' and push enter. This will open the project in visual studio code. To start and test this application, run 'node index.js' in Terminal, after navigating to the server folder. Enter in '/logs' to see a full set of log requests after several requests have been made.
